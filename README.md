### Milestone Report

**In your submission's README.md, provide a report of your progress. Include the following information:**

**What's done.**

We have made significant strides in the Landing Page. We currently have a hero image and a unique selling proposition as well as everything laid out. We have also decided
to use React as it is simpler to use.

**What's not done.**

Right now, we are in the process of making the necessary wireframes to base the rest of our pages off of. We would like to implement a login page, a page showing the calendar, and a settings page.

**List all the pages/components of the web app. Provide wireframes for pages not complete.**

‚ùå - Not Started, üî∂ - In Progress, ‚úîÔ∏è - Finished

Page | Status | Wireframe 
--- | --- | --- 
Landing | üî∂ | 
Login | ‚ùå | 
Calendar | ‚ùå | 
Settings | ‚ùå |

**List all the endpoints of the web app. For each endpoint, provide a description of the route, and expected behavior of the endpoint.**

We currently do not have any endpoints. (List endpoints here).

### Elevator Pitch

My team is **building a life-planning assistant application** to help **college students** **improve their mental and physical health while staying on top of their responsibilities** by **utilizing the Google Calendar API to organize calendars conditionally as opposed to chronologically.**
