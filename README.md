[Setting Up For Local Development](https://github.ncsu.edu/CSC-WebApps-F21/WEBAPPS-10/blob/94086617bc64e6c5e77728b1e364f6c1b6813442/SETUP.md)

### Milestone Report

**In your submission's README.md, provide a report of your progress. Include the following information:**

**What's done.**

We have finished up the landing page! It has the necessary unique selling proposition, a hero image, the benefits, and a call to action. We have created wireframes for all the necessary pages right now (we don't have one for settings as we created the page before the design). There is a static about us/contact us page and a settings page. The calendar and login pages are finished on the front end and we have made a good start in implementing the back-end.

**What's not done.**

We need to finish up the implementation behind the calendar and the login page. We also need to make the about us/contact us and settings pages have a back-end implementation. Calendar relies on the log in so that may not be completely visible yet, and the backend behind the settings page will rely on the calendar's main functionality being finished.

**List all the pages/components of the web app. Provide wireframes for pages not complete.**

### Elevator Pitch

My team is **building a life-planning assistant application** to help **college students** **improve their mental and physical health while staying on top of their responsibilities** by **utilizing the Google Calendar API to organize calendars conditionally as opposed to chronologically.**
