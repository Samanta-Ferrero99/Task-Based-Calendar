### Milestone Report

**In your submission's README.md, provide a report of your progress. Include the following information:

**What's done.
What's not done.
List all the pages/components of the web app. Provide wireframes for pages not complete.
List all the endpoints of the web app. For each endpoint, provide a description of the route, and expected behavior of the endpoint.

We have made significant strides in the Landing Page. We currently have a hero image and a unique selling proposition as well as everything laid out. We have also decided
to use React as it is simpler to use.

Right now, we are in the process of making the necessary wireframes to base the rest of our pages off of. We would like to implement a login page, a page showing the calendar, and a settings page.

We currently do not have any endpoints. (List endpoints here).

### Elevator Pitch

My team is **building a life-planning assistant application** to help **college students** **improve their mental and physical health while staying on top of their responsibilities** by **utilizing the Google Calendar API to organize calendars conditionally as opposed to chronologically.**
